# Searchless
An anti-search engine - it gets your search request and does nothing with it.<br>
Intended for use with a web browser that supports custom search engines.

It took me about an hour to get working.

## How to use
Configure your web browser to use the search engine link as follows:
```url
speedstriker243.github.io/searchless/?q=%s
```
