# Searchless
An anti-search engine - it gets your search request and does nothing with it.<br>
Intended for use with a web browser that supports custom search engines.

It took me about an hour to get working.

(Your browser needs to support JavaScript's replaceAll function for this to work.)

## How to use
Configure your web browser to use the search engine link as follows:
```url
speedstriker243.github.io/searchless/?q=%s
```

## Tracking
Searchless does not track you. At all. We literally just take your request and deny it, nothing else happens -- you can take a look at the code if you want.

Hard to track someone when your main purpose is to be useless, anyway...
